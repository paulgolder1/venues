The Venues Project - creating a new linked data source from open data

This repository has two folders holding all of the necessary files for this project:

**python**

all of the python files involved in collating and cleaning Open Data before creating Linked Data in the form of a Turtle triplestore.

**website**

a backup of the website http://s650100879.websitehome.co.uk/finalproject/ in which end users can query the triplestore created.
